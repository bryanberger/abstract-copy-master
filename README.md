# Abstract Master Sketch File Copy/Sync

## Workflow
-   **Step 1:** Change the `REPO_ID`, `FILE_ID`, and `DEST_DIR` variables
-   **Step 2:** Make sure to open the Sketch file(s) via Abstract at least once for it to generate file(s) that we can copy. Opening it untracked is does the trick.
-   **Step 3:** run `npm start`
-   **Step 4:** Check your `DEST_DIR` for the output
